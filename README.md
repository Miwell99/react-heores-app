# Welcome!
This is the repository of a SPA app developed by Miguel Gonz√°lez Bravo (miguelinformatica01@gmail.com). The main objective is to show the React and other Front skills from Miguel. You can access it from [here](https://miwell99.github.io/react-heores-app/)

This app has been built following the online curse: [React de cero a experto](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-cero-experto/) from Udemy e-learning, adding some more code by me. The App is about show, filter and navigate throught Super Heroes from DC Comics & Marvel. Enjoy!

# Front Skills:
- JavaScript ES6.
- Route protection for no logged users (if doesn't logged in, can't navigate to /marvel page f.e.).
- React Hooks (and custom Hooks).
- Bootstrap and some CSS (with libraries for effects).
- Re-usage of components.
- Cookies.
- App Context to access global data.
- Remembers the last user view.
- Local API access (not remote yet).

# Tips:
- There is no backend yet so don't worry for your data when login. It its saved as cookies.
- You can search by 'green' to obtain more than one character by name on search view. It search by name of superheroes only.
